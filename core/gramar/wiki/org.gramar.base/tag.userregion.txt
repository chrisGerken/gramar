==== userRegion Tag ====

The userRegion tag scopes a region of template processing that might be modified by the user after generation and should therefore be kept (not overwritten on subsequent gramar invocations).

The userRegion tag will contain a single initialCode tag that breaks the userRegion tag content into three sections: before eyecatcher, modifiable content and after eyecatcher.  The before and after eyecatchers may contain other Gramar markup tags and are used to locate the modifiable region in existing files.
