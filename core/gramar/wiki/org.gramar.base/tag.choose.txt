==== choose Tag ====

The choose tag provides case-style conditional logic.  The choose tag will have nested some number of when tags and possibly an otherwise tag.  The first when tag to test true will be resolved to become the processing result of the entire choose tag.  If no when tag tests true and an otherwise tag is present, the otherwise tag is resolved to produce the result of the entire choose tag.
