==== initialCode Tag ====

The initialCode tag Scopes a region of template processing that might be modified by the user after generation and should therefore be kept (not overwritten on subsequent gramar invocations).

The initialCode tag is always nested within a userRegion tag and breaks that userRegion tag content into three sections: before eyecatcher, modifiable content and after eyecatcher.  The before and after eyecatchers may contain other Gramar markup tags and are used to locate the modifiable region in existing files.
